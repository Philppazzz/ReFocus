# ReFocus

**Screen-Locking Android Application Using Decision Tree for Managing Screen-Time Overuse**

ReFocus is an academic thesis project that aims to help users build healthier digital habits by intelligently monitoring and managing their smartphone usage.  
The app uses **Artificial Intelligence (Decision Tree Machine Learning model)** to detect overuse patterns and automatically control access to distracting apps like games and social media.

## 📱 About the App

ReFocus analyzes a user’s daily phone activity and identifies excessive usage behavior.  
When the system detects overuse, it can **temporarily lock specific apps** to encourage mindful breaks and balanced device usage.

It also provides **visual insights and analytics**, allowing users to see where their time is spent and take steps to improve their digital well-being.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** The app records screen time and usage patterns.  
2. **ML Analysis:** The Decision Tree model classifies behavior as *normal* or *excessive*.  
3. **App Restriction:** When excessive use is detected, the app locks selected distracting apps.  
4. **User Feedback:** Insights and reminders encourage users to refocus and take breaks.
